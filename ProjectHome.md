# Introduction #

Inspired by Google Testability Explorer(by [Mi≈°ko Hevery](http://misko.hevery.com/)), Joe and I initialized this project to implement the same idea on .NET platform. Most of the analysis work to the .NET assembly based on Mono.Cecil(by [JB Evain](http://evain.net/)). And the cost model is based on the original design in GTE.
