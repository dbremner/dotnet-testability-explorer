For developers, how to build the project

Environment requirement:
 # VS2008
 # Subversion

Steps:
 # Checkout code
 # Open \src\Testability.Explorer.sln 
 # Build
 # Run unit tests

All dependency like C5, NUnit, Cecil are referenced using relative path, so there is no need to configured by default. Have fun!

Caution:
Currently we are in a very coarse codebase. There are about 19 unit tests failed due to an algorithm. But for collaborate purpose, I(Liwen) commited all the code. Have fun and take the risk by yourself for now. :)
