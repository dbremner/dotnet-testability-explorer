= Introduction =

Inspired by Google Testability Explorer(by [http://misko.hevery.com/ Mi≈°ko Hevery]), Joe and I initialized this project to implement the same idea on .NET platform. Most of the analysis work to the .NET assembly based on Mono.Cecil(by [http://evain.net/ JB Evain]). And the cost model is based on the original design in GTE. 

Thanks all the people for the contribution to GTE and Mono.Cecil.

I hope to release the first runnable version during Christmas holiday in 2008 or in early of Jan 2009. I am busy working on that. Joe will help me to review the migration work and have discussion with me  on the release scope.
