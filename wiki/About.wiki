= Introduction =

Inspired by Google Testability Explorer(by ), Joe and I initialized this project to implement the same idea on .NET platform. Most of the analysis work to the .NET assembly based on Mono Cecil(by ). And the cost model is based on the original design in GTE. 

Thanks all the people contribute to GTE and Mono.Cecil.

I hope to release the first runnable version during Christmas holiday in 2008. I am busy working on that. Joe will help me to review the migration work and have discussion with me  on the release scope.
